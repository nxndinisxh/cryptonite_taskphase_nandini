1st challenge is about learning how to access a program named `pwn` using the `/pwn` command. `/` is the symbol for the root directory, the words following it are the names of the programs/paths that follow.
`/pwn` is the path to the pwn program under the root directory.
Flag was obtained by entering `/pwn` command on the terminal
